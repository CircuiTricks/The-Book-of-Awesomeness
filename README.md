The world is advancing today, with new technologies that come up; it is no more the ancient world of manual work. Its time where robots and complex technologies do things we have always dreamt of. The roots of this technology are embedded deep within their circuits. Every technological device is perfectly woven in threads of wires and complex circuits. With all the wires and complex structures, it is challenging to make a circuit if you wish to innovate a new device. But what if you can just draw it out!

You do not need a highly sophisticated pen to do it; just take a pencil and a paper to draw out your circuit. And weâ€™ll tell you how to make it work!   The CircuiTricks Book of Awesomeness is about creating electronic circuits with paper! This book will teach you how you can make your own electrical circuits by using just a paper and a pencil. All you have to do is draw the circuit! This will include creative things like making a music system using, making disco lights, creating your own motor plane and creating your own games using a paper and a pencil! This might be the most mind sparking creative maker book you would have ever read!
